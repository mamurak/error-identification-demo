      ## **Overview**
      The **AmlValidationService** evaluates the anti-money laundering (AML)
       risk of customers by scoring them based on their identity attributes and
       checking against known watchlists. This is part of the customer
       onboarding KYC pipeline in a banking context.

      * Validate all required fields are included and types are correct
      ---
      ### **2\. HTTP 404 Not Found**
      **Symptoms:**
      * Endpoint returns 404
      **Logs:**
      ```
      WARN [platform-http] - No consumers available on endpoint:
       platform-http:/
      ```
      **Root Causes:**
      * Camel route not active or incorrectly mapped
      **Resolution:**
      * Check YAML DSL route definition, ensure `path: /` matches actual
       request URL
      ---
      ### **3\. HTTP 500 Internal Server Error**
      **Symptoms:**
      * Runtime failure during  external service dependency failure
      **Logs:**
      ```
      ERROR [camel] - Error evaluating choice block:
       java.lang.NullPointerException
      ```
      **Root Causes:**
      * Incorrect use of Camel Simple expressions (`random()` or string
       interpolation)
      * Unexpected downstream error
      **Resolution:**
      * Add fallback logic for downstream errors
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          The AmlValidationService returns HTTP code 400. What went wrong, and
           how can I fix this?
        answer: |
          The AmlValidationService returns HTTP 400 if the incoming request
           payload is incomplete or improperly formatted. Ensure that the
           payload sent by the client contains all required fields and its
           value types are correct.
      - question: |
          The AmlValidationService returns HTTP code 404. What went wrong, and
           how can I fix this?
        answer: |
          The AmlValidationService returns HTTP 404 if the Camel route is
           inactive or not mapped correctly. Validate the YAML DSL route
           definition and check whether the correct route URL is used.
      - question: |
          The AmlValidationService returns HTTP code 500. What went wrong, and
           how can I fix this?
        answer: |
          The AmlValidationService returns HTTP code 500 in case of incorrect
           Camel expressions or downstream processing errors. This should be
           addressed by ensuring correct fallback for downstream processing.

      ## **Log Interpretation Guide**

      | Log Pattern | Meaning | Suggested Action |
      | ----- | ----- | ----- |
      | `Evaluating AML validation outcome...` | Request successfully reached
       the route | Continue |
      | `No consumers available` | Route is not registered for that path |
       Check Camel route URI |
      | `NullPointerException` in mock logic | Incorrect JSON template or
       unquoted interpolation | Check indentation and syntax |
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          I'm seeing a log entry starting with "Evaluating AML validation
           outcome". Does this indicate an issue that I should fix?
        answer: |
          This log pattern occurs if the client request has been routed
           successfully. No action needs to be taken.
      - question: |
          I'm seeing the following log entry: "No consumers available". Does
           this indicate an issue that I should fix?
        answer: |
          Yes, this log usually occurs if the path is not associated with a
           registered route. Double check the Camel route URI.
      - question: |
          I'm seeing a log with a NullPointerException. Does this indicate an
           issue that I should fix?
        answer: |
          Yes, a NullPointerException is typically logged if JSON template is
           incorrect or there's interpolation that hasn't been quoted. You
           should double check the syntax and indentation.

      # **IdentityValidationService Technical Documentation**

      ## **Overview**

      The **IdentityValidationService** is responsible for validating customer
       identity documents such as national IDs or passports. It is used in KYC
       (Know Your Customer) workflows in banking systems. The service exposes a
       REST endpoint `/validate` that accepts a JSON payload with customer
       identity details and returns a validation result.

      ---

      ## **API Endpoint**

      **POST** `/validate`

      ### **Request Schema:**

      * `customerId` (string)  
      * `fullName` (string)  
      * `nationalId` (string)  
      * `birthDate` (date)

      ### **Response Fields:**

      * `status`: `VERIFIED`, `FAILED`, or `REVIEW_REQUIRED`  
      * `verificationScore`: integer (0–100)  
      * `failureReason`, `reviewComment`: string (optional)  
      * `timestamp`: ISO-8601

      ---

      ## **Common Error Patterns**

      ### **1\. HTTP 400 Bad Request**

      **Symptoms:**

      * Empty or malformed request payload  
      * Missing required fields

      **Logs:**

      ```
      ERROR [validation] - Missing field 'nationalId'
      ERROR [json] - Cannot deserialize value...
      ```

      **Root Causes:**

      * Client-side form submission error  
      * Incorrect JSON formatting (e.g., using single quotes, missing commas)

      **Resolution:**

      * Ensure all required fields are populated  
      * Validate request body using a linter or Postman before submitting

      ---

      ### **2\. HTTP 404 Not Found**

      **Symptoms:**

      * Service route is unreachable

      **Logs:**

      ```
      WARN [platform-http] - No consumers available on endpoint:
       platform-http:/validate
      ```

      **Root Causes:**

      * Camel REST route not correctly defined or not deployed  
      * OpenShift Route misconfigured

      **Resolution:**

      * Confirm route configuration in Camel YAML DSL  
      * Run `oc get routes` and verify exposed service path

      ---

      ### **3\. HTTP 500 Internal Server Error**

      **Symptoms:**

      * Service returns error with no obvious client fault

      **Logs:**

      ```
      ERROR [identity-service] - Unexpected exception occurred:
       java.lang.NullPointerException
      ERROR [camel] - Error during route processing
      ```

      **Root Causes:**

      * Backend system (e.g., registry API) unavailable  
      * Null reference in identity processing logic

      **Resolution:**

      * Add null checks and fallback values in route logic  
      * Ensure downstream services are healthy
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          The IdentityValidationService returns HTTP code 400. What went wrong,
           and how can I fix this?
        answer: |
          The IdentityValidationService returns HTTP 400 in case of client-side
           request issues. Ensure that the payload sent by the client contains
           all required fields and validate the payload via a linter or a tool
           like Postman.
      - question: |
          The IdentityValidationService returns HTTP code 404. What went wrong,
           and how can I fix this?
        answer: |
          The IdentityValidationService returns HTTP 404 if the Camel route is
           inactive or the route in OpenShift is misconfigured. Validate the
           YAML DSL route definition and check whether the correct route URL is
           used by comparing with the output of `oc get routes`.
      - question: |
          The IdentityValidationService returns HTTP code 500. What went wrong, and
           how can I fix this?
        answer: |
          The IdentityValidationService returns HTTP code 500 in case of
           unavailable backend components or null references within the logic
           of identity processing. Double check null handling within the service
           and verify the downstream components are up and running.

      ## **Log Interpretation Guide**

      | Log Pattern | Meaning | Suggested Action |
      | ----- | ----- | ----- |
      | `Missing field 'X'` | Input JSON did not include a required field |
       Fix client request |
      | `No consumers available` | No route matching the HTTP call | Check
       Camel route URI |
      | `Error calling downstream service` | HTTP call to AML/KYC failed |
       Check URL, service availability |
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          I'm seeing a log entry with the following pattern: "Missing field".
           Does this indicate an issue that I should fix?
        answer: |
          Yes, this log entry indicates that there's a missing field within
           the incoming JSON. Double check the client's request.
      - question: |
          I'm seeing the following log entry: "No consumers available". Does
           this indicate an issue that I should fix?
        answer: |
          Yes, this log usually occurs if HTTP call does not match any
           available routes. Double check the Camel route URI.
      - question: |
          I'm seeing a log that states: "Error calling downstream service".
           Does this indicate an issue that I should fix?
        answer: |
          Yes, this entry is logged whenever a call to the AML or KYC
           components fails. Verify that the corresponding URLs are correct
           and that these services are available.
